Gcolor3
=========

**A simple color chooser dialog written in GTK3, much alike Gcolor2.**

Installation
------------

The only dependency required to build and run Gcolor3, is GTK3.

Once the ridiculous amount of dependencies are installed, just run these commands to build and install Gcolor3:

	$ ./autogen
    $ make
    # make clean install

Translations
-----------

You can help translate Gcolor3 in your language!
To do so, simply follow these steps:

	$ cd po
	$ intltool-update --pot
	$ mv gcolor3.pot <language code>.po

Where `<language code>` is, obviously, the code of your language (e.g. `nl` for Dutch, `fr` for French, `en` for English...)
Edit the `LINGUAS` file and add your language code. Please keep the list alphabetically.
Lastly, open the .po file you just generated and translate all the strings. Don't forget to fill in the information in the header!

* `~/.rgb.txt` does not get initialized at startup, resulting in emptry treeview. saving a color resolves this.
* Figure out how to install our .desktop file.
* Use our own icon instead of stealing Gcolor2's?
